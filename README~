Various applications of MPI. Written for a problem set in Computer Science 205
at Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

	dot_sum: 
		- uses broadcast and reduce to compute a product sum of two
		  vectors
		- serial version provided by cs205 course staff
	tomography: 
		- produces an x-ray image from the series of attenuation curves
                  in a tomographic projection
		- 3 implementations:
			1. send/recv 
			2. scatter/reduce 
			3. serial (provided by cs205 course staff)
	mandelbrot:
		- computes a mandelbrot set
		- 3 implementations:
			1. scatter/gather
			2. master/slave
			3. serial (provided by cs205 course staff)
